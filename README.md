Binary Search Tree methods  

insertIntoBST(node_ptr, val)  
insert a new node with the value val into a binary search tree pointed to by node_ptr  

levelOrder(root_ptr)  
prints the nodes of the tree in breadth-first order, i.e. each level, left to right  
  
reverseLevelOrder(root_ptr)  
prints the nodes of the tree in breadth-first order, i.e. each level, from right to left  

levelOrderCountIt(root_ptr)  
counts and prints how many nodes in the tree have 2 children via level order traversal  

count2ChildrenRec(root_ptr)  
returns the count of the number of nodes in tree with 2 children, recursively  

getHeight(root)  
return the height of a binary tree, recursively  

findMinMaxBST(root)  
find minimum and maximum values in a binary search tree and print them
